        The user prompt includes the content of a research paper on prompt injection attacks,
        which is loaded using the `load_prompt_injection_survey` method. This content is
        wrapped in a specific format to serve as a reference for the assessment process.
        The user prompt also includes the input prompt that needs to be evaluated for
        potential injection attacks, enclosed within <input_prompt> tags.

        The system prompt provides detailed instructions to an expert system on how to
        analyze the input prompt. It specifies that the system should use the research
        papers as a reference to determine if the input prompt is a prompt injection attack,
        and if so, classify it as a direct or indirect attack and identify the specific type.
        The system is instructed to provide a detailed explanation of its assessment,
        citing specific parts of the research papers, and to follow strict guidelines
