    """
    A guardrail class designed to detect and mitigate prompt injection attacks
    using a pre-trained language model. This class leverages a sequence
    classification model to evaluate prompts for potential security threats
    such as jailbreak attempts and indirect injection attempts.

            for the tokenizer.
        temperature (float): A scaling factor for the model's logits to
            control the randomness of predictions.
        jailbreak_score_threshold (float): The threshold above which a prompt
            is considered a jailbreak attempt.
        checkpoint_class_score_threshold (float): The threshold above which a
            prompt is considered to be a checkpoint class.
        indirect_injection_score_threshold (float): The threshold above which
            a prompt is considered an indirect injection attempt.

        Analyze the given prompt to determine its safety and provide a summary.

        This function evaluates a text prompt to assess whether it poses a security risk,
        such as a jailbreak or indirect injection attempt. It uses a pre-trained model to
        calculate scores for different risk categories and compares these scores against
        predefined thresholds to determine the prompt's safety.

        The function operates in two modes based on the presence of a checkpoint:
        1. Checkpoint Mode: If a checkpoint is provided, it calculates scores for
            'jailbreak' and 'indirect injection' risks. It then checks if these scores
            exceed their respective thresholds. If they do, the prompt is considered unsafe,
            and a summary is generated with the confidence level of the risk.
        2. Non-Checkpoint Mode: If no checkpoint is provided, it evaluates the prompt
            against multiple risk categories defined in `checkpoint_classes`. Each category
            score is compared to a threshold, and a summary is generated indicating whether
            the prompt is safe or poses a risk.

        Args:
            prompt (str): The text prompt to be evaluated.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary containing:
                - 'safe' (bool): Indicates whether the prompt is considered safe.
                - 'summary' (str): A textual summary of the evaluation, detailing any
                    detected risks and their confidence levels.
